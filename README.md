# Loan Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a **Loan Analysis Dashboard** built to visualize key metrics related to loan applications, income, home ownership, employment, and loan purposes. The dashboard presents data insights using various charts and visual representations to assist in financial decision-making.

## Features
- **Total Loans Overview**: Displays total loan count, average annual income, default rate, and delinquency history.
- **Loan Distribution by Home Ownership**: Shows the count of loans categorized by homeownership status (Own, Rent, Mortgage).
- **Loan Count by Years in Current Job**: Illustrates the relationship between job tenure and loan approvals.
- **Loan Purpose Analysis**: Breaks down loan applications by purpose, such as debt consolidation, home improvements, medical bills, etc.
- **Employment vs Loan Trends**: Highlights loan distributions based on employment history and loan IDs.
- **Credit Score and Loan Amount Trends**: Analyzes the correlation between credit scores, income, and current loan amounts.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI / Tableau** *(or specify the tool used for visualization)*
- **Python / SQL** *(if data processing is involved)*
- **Excel / CSV** *(for raw data input)*

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmanRai264/loan-analysis-dashboard.git
   ```
2. Open the dashboard file in **Power BI / Tableau**.
3. Load the dataset and refresh the visualizations.
4. Explore insights and interact with different dashboard components.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is stored in `cleaned_data.xlsx` and includes:

- Loan details (amount, tenure, purpose, etc.)
- Borrower information (income, job status, credit score, home ownership, etc.)


## Insights & Findings

- **Majority of Loans** are taken for **Debt Consolidation** (\~79%).
- **Most Borrowers** are renters, with a significant portion having home mortgages.
- **Higher Loan Approvals** are observed among individuals with **longer job tenure**.
- **Credit Score Distribution** is skewed, indicating a few high-score applicants receive the majority of loans.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement **Machine Learning Models** for risk prediction.
- Add **real-time loan approval trends** using live data feeds.
- Optimize dashboard performance with advanced filtering.
